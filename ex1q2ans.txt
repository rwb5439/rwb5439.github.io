If your plot looks anything like mine, you can certainly see a nice main sequence but there are outliers. Possible causes for this include unresolved binaries (which should sit just above the main sequence) and interlopers, which are stars not really in the Hyades that happen to occupy the same physical space as the bulk of the cluster. You may additionally see some stars that have evolved off the main sequence onto the red giant branch!
